# Module2_Challenge- Allen Shih
	
	Based on the data of 2017 and 2018, we can easily understand that the following stocks are no in the good shape and those are ready to sell: DQ (-61%), JKS(-59%),SPWR (-41%), FLSR(-37%) and CSIQ (-15%). On the otherhand, we do have two strong profolios of "ENPH" and "RUN". 
	For those return between -10% to 0%, i believe it has room to improve. We can still keep it for a while.


	*I have copy and paste my VBA code in the seperate section so Steve can applys to his own excel sheet.
